# Allstate Claims Severity Prediction End-to-End Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting the cost of claims using LightGBM which is originated from the Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/allstate-claims-severity/overview). The project contains modular pipelines (feature, training, inference), experiment tracking using MLflow, and comprehensive testing. It also contains a simple API application that serves the trained model.
